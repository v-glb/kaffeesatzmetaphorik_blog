Welcome to my blog! Here, I write about my experiences in Muay Thai training. This includes training experiences, insights, techniques, tips & tricks, and much more. All information is, of course, provided without guarantee and is based solely on personal experiences. ;)

I have just over two years of experience, so I’m still relatively new to it—but perhaps because of that, it fulfills me to such an extent that I decided to combine two of my hobbies: Muay Thai and writing. The result is the blog you’re currently reading.

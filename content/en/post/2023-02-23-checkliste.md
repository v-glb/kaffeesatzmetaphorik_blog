Just like I overthought things before my first training session, many out there are probably struggling with the same question: How fit should I be before training Muay Thai for the first time? The basic thought seems logical and reasonable: If I’ve spent X weeks, months, or maybe years preparing with sports Y or Z, I shouldn't have any worries. Right?

That’s why I came up with the idea of creating a sort of checklist to guide people. After all, the first training session should be perfect. So here’s a list of things you should definitely do before trying Muay Thai for the first time:

- absolutely nothing.

Just start!

This is the best advice I can give. If you start thinking that a special preparation is necessary, you’ll never begin. I spent years standing in my own way with thoughts like this. Before I came to Muay Thai, I was a more or less ambitious runner. I thought that running would help me build a good base of endurance, which is technically true. Yet the whole idea of preparing like this was a hindrance.

In late 2021, I ran my first half marathon, around 22 kilometers in just under 2 ½ hours. An achievement I’m undoubtedly proud of – but I still doubted whether it was enough to handle Muay Thai. I started adding fitness training, doing bodyweight exercises in my modest living room. The thought here was that I was too weak to even attempt any combat sport and needed to build mass first.

Another unnecessary mental hurdle that I put in my own way.

## What It's Really Like

In my opinion, a full-contact sport like Muay Thai is unlike anything you might have done before. Your entire body is challenged in a unique way, and it will definitely wear you out after the first session – no matter how fit you are (and if you’re not completely exhausted after the first session, then you simply didn’t train hard enough or give it your all).

There’s also a mental component. The fear of taking hits and having to endure them is a completely new experience that you have to process and react to. It takes time to overcome it or at least manage it to some extent.

At my Muay Thai gym, I see all kinds of people: skinny, overweight, tall, short, athletic, average, or somewhere in between. It doesn’t matter. We’re all on the mat because we want to improve ourselves, and because it’s fun. No one is laughed at or looked at sideways; on the contrary, everyone is supported.

## Just Start

Just starting is the best advice I can give. Fitness will come with time; with each training session, you’ll get a little better and endure a bit more. I remember, for example, the warm-up during my first training session: the long jump rope session exhausted my calves so much that I could barely walk for the next two days. Yet, I was back on the mat at the next session, facing the jump rope again. My calves protested loudly, but I pushed through, and sure enough, it got better. I gradually adapted to the strain.

Or take another example: hitting the heavy bag with my shins was extremely painful at first, and I couldn’t imagine ever doing it with full force. But I stuck with it, and now I worry more about my furniture when I accidentally kick a table leg than about my shins.

The body is an amazing and incredibly adaptable wonder of nature, and most of all, it’s far more resilient than you might think.

That’s why I can only repeat: if you have the desire to learn Muay Thai, the only preparation you need is finding a good gym nearby, scheduling a trial session, and showing up. The rest will come with time.

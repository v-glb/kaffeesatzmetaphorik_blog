Since I started Muay Thai in January 2022, I have allowed this sport to become a very strong part of my identity. On one hand, it had its benefits: it fulfilled me, brought me joy, and showed me that there is much more within me than I would have thought—both physically and mentally. On the other hand, however, it raised an entirely new problem:

What should I do when external circumstances forced me to pause the sport? Who was I then?

I had to confront this question last month because I found myself in exactly that situation, and I still am. Due to surgery, I was forced to reduce not only my Muay Thai training but also sports in general to a minimum. In the first week after my hospital stay, which lasted only a few days, walking was the most I could demand from my weakened body. By the third week, I could at least start jogging lightly, even though I had to be careful not to overdo it (which I did at first and was immediately met with corresponding pain the next day).

The fundamental problem was: What should I do with my days now that my most important outlet was missing? I felt deeply out of balance and agitated, which was further exacerbated by excessive sitting in front of the computer and playing video games. Of course, I had to take it easy, according to the doctors, about 6-8 weeks, but I still felt guilty. Guilty for slipping back into a passive "living day by day" mentality without goals, without direction, and without fulfillment. I was doing exactly what I had always done during my couch potato days: sitting in front of my laptop from morning till night, aimlessly surfing the internet, and playing video games.

I feared I would slide back into my former self and felt like a loser.

I was so focused on the fact that I couldn’t engage in sports for a while that I overlooked all the other possibilities in my current situation. I could have used the time, for example, to read or to intensively learn a new language. I could have returned to playing the guitar. Generally, a creative outlet would likely have been just what I needed during my recovery, yet I ignored all these opportunities for leisure and could only see the negative.

In other words, I had forgotten that I am much more than just a Muay Thai fighter. The more I reflect on the experiences of the last week, the more I realize how shortsighted I was during that phase. It’s good to have a passion and to burn for something, but at the same time, one should not lose sight of the bigger picture. A person is not one-dimensional but multifaceted.

My brother had warned me not to fall into the trap of absolutism. He was right, and I had indeed fallen into that trap.

For the future, I now know that even in such unexpected phases of life, there are opportunities. There are always chances and always ways to make the best of a situation, no matter how dire it may seem. Everything is a matter of perspective, and fortunately, I was able to readjust mine.

> Who has stolen our time?  
> A feeling of nostalgia  
> While the snow cover is melting.  

> Too thin, fleeting to endure  
> Still beautiful to behold  
> A smile on the lips.  

> Step by step  
> A vague image of the sun  
> Struggling through the curtain of clouds.  

> The fog in the mind lifts  
> Lost feelings become accessible again  
> How long have we been away?  

> The pen is suddenly no longer just a tool  
> But an immediate expression  
> Of our self.  

> How beautiful to be here again.  

> To see.  
> To hear.  
> To feel.
